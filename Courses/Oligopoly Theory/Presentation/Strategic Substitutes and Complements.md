What is a more "aggressive strategy"?

In Price competition, more "aggressive strategy" is lower price.
In Quantity competition, more "aggressive strategy" is higher quantity. 

- If a "*more aggressive strategy*" by Firm A **reduces total profits** for Firm B, then the strategy is Substitute. 
- If a "*more aggressive strategy*" by Firm A **increases total profit** for firm B, then the strategy is Complement. 

- If a "*more aggressive strategy"* by Firm A **reduces Marginal Profit** for firm B, then the strategy is Strategic Substitute.
- If a "*more aggressive strategy*" by Firm A **increases Marginal Profit** for Firm B, then the strategy is Strategic Complement. 

#### A proper definition of Strategic Substitutes and Complements

Assume that firm A is monopolist in one market, market 1, and a duopolist with B in another market, market 2. 
Firm A chooses strategic variables $S_1^A, S_2^A$ and Firm B simultaneously chooses $S_2^B$. 

$\mathbf{Y}$=$\frac{\partial^2 \pi^B}{\partial S_2^B \partial S_2^A}$  is then the term representing the change in the marginal profitability to firm B of being a bit more "aggressive" when firm A becomes more aggressive. Now the term can be of either sign, positive or negative. 

If  $\mathbf{Y}$ is negative, we say that firm B regards its product as a **strategic substitute** to firm A. That is, Firm B's optimal response to more aggressive play by A is to be less aggressive. If Firm A increases $S_2^A$ , Firm B's optimal decision is to decrease $S_2^B$. 

If $\mathbf{Y}$ is positive, we say that firm B regards its products as **strategic complements** to Firm A. That is, Firm B's optimal response to more aggressive play be A is to be more aggressive. If Firm A increases $S_2^A$, Firm B's optimal decision is to increase $S_2^B$

#### A proper definition of Pure Substitutes and Complements

- **Pure Substitutes:** $\frac{\partial \pi^B}{\partial S_2^A}<0$ , that is, B earns less **total profits** if A adopts a more "aggressive strategy".
-  **Pure Complements:** $\frac{\partial \pi^B}{\partial S_2^A}>0$ , that is, B earns more **total profits** if A adopts a more "aggressive strategy".
