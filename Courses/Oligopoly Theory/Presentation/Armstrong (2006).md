One group's benefit from joining a platform depends on the size of the other group that joins the platform. In this paper, the design of the market is given. The author looks for determinant of equilibrium prices, which are: (i) the magnitude of the cross-group externality, (ii) whether fees are levied on a lump-sum or per transaction basis, (iii) whether agent joins one platform or several platforms. 

### Introduction 

In Platforms, agents or group of agents interact. Surplus is created or destroyed as the groups interact. For example, any firm(platform)is likely to do better if it appeals to both male and female. A heterosexual night club is going to do well if it attracts both male and female. A retailer is going to pay more to a shopping mall which attracts more consumer, similarly, a consumer is more likely to visit a mall with large number of retailers. 

There are three main factors which determine the structure of prices offered to the two groups:
- **Relative Size of cross-group externalities:** If in a heterosexual nightclub, men are more appealed to visit a night club just because more women visit it, the nightclub owner would charge very less fee for women then man to allow them entry. It is group 1's (women's) benefit to the other group(men) that determines group 1's price, not how much group 1 benefits from the presence of group 2. 
- **Fixed fees or per transaction charges:**
