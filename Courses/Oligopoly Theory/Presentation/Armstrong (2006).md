One group's benefit from joining a platform depends on the size of the other group that joins the platform. In this paper, the design of the market is given. The author looks for determinant of equilibrium prices, which are: (i) the magnitude of the cross-group externality, (ii) whether fees are levied on a lump-sum or per transaction basis, (iii) whether agent joins one platform or several platforms. 

### Introduction 

In Platforms, agents or group of agents interact. Surplus is created or destroyed as the groups interact. For example, any firm(platform)is likely to do better if it appeals to both male and female. A heterosexual night club is going to do well if it attracts both male and female. A retailer is going to pay more to a shopping mall which attracts more consumer, similarly, a consumer is more likely to visit a mall with large number of retailers. 

There are three main factors which determine the structure of prices offered to the two groups:
- **Relative Size of cross-group externalities:** If in a heterosexual nightclub, men are more appealed to visit a night club just because more women visit it, the nightclub owner would charge very less fee for women then man to allow them entry. It is group 1's (women's) benefit to the other group(men) that determines group 1's price, not how much group 1 benefits from the presence of group 2. 
- **Fixed fees or per transaction charges:** Platform may either charge for their service on a lump-sum basis, or alternatively, the payment may be an explicit function of the platform's performance on the other side. For example of the latter side, A Television channel charges the advertiser on the basis of how many viewers watch that specific channel. In the case of per transaction charges, the benefit of interacting with an extra agent on the other side is eroded by the extra payment incurred. Now because the fee tot he platform is on per transaction basis, the benefits of cross group externality is not captured fully as some part of it goes as fee to the platform. 
- **Single-Homing or Multi-Homing:** When an agent chooses to use only one platform, it is called single-homing and when an agent uses multiple platform, it is called multi-homing. They consider three cases: (i) both groups single-home (ii) both groups multi-home (iii) one group single home while others multi-home(often termed as [["competitive bottleneck"]]. Interacting with the other agent shouldn't be the only reason to join a platform or else we won't see case (ii). For case (iii), every mobile company selling their mobiles on exclusive platform, like OnePLus on Amazon and Motorola in Flipkart.
