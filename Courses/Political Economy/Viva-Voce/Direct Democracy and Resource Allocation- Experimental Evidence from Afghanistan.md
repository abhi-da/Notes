#### Abstract 

Direct Democracy is designed is designed to better align policy outcomes with citizen preferences. To test this proposition, the authors randomised 250 villages across Afghanistan selected projects by secret-ballot referenda or by consultation meetings. They find that referenda reduce the influence of local elites over both project type and location . Consistent with previous experimental results, they also find that referenda improve villagers' perceptions of the local economy and of the quality of local governance. However, they also find no systematic evidence that selecting projects via referenda increases the average impact of such projects.

#### What does the *Abstract* mean?

The authors want to check whether *direct democracy* leads to policy decisions that better match citizen's preferences compared to *consultation meetings*. This is a *Randomised Control Trial* study, where authors randomly assigned 250 villages in Afghanistan to two types of design- (i) *Direct Democracy* and (ii) *Consultation meeting*.

The Authors find that *direct  democracy* reduces the influence of local elites over what kind of project the village needed and which location the project was going to be implemented. They also find evidences of improvement of villager's perception of the local economy and the quality of governance. Something like, The villagers had better trust in governance when they themselves elected their policies.

However, the authors didn't find any systematic difference in project outcomes.

## Introduction

Decentralisation is transference of power from the central government to the local authorities and it is seen as a way which promotes good governance, better accountability, better policy making which matches local preferences, etc. However, in many developing countries, the local elites (wealthy, local political leader, etc) divert the resources for their own benefit. Direct Democracy is thought to be that tool which helps in better resource allocation in accordance to people's preferences. So the authors asks this question- *whether direct democracy is an effective tool to reduce elite capture over the allocation*.

- A field experiment
- 250 villages randomly selected
- The norm in Afghanistan is mostly policy making with consultation making. Direct Democracy is against that norm.
- 125 villages were randomly assigned to select project through secret-ballot methodology and the remaining were assigned to select project through elected village development council.
- **Treatment Group:** Villages where projects are selected through secret-ballot method.
- **Control Group:** Villages where projects are selected through consultation meetings. 
- On referendum procedure, project fund allocation is decided based on most votes received while the consultation meeting procedure allocated funds based on the decision by village elected council members. 
- In order to isolate the effect of direct democracy on allocation outcomes and on the ability of the elites to realise their preferences specifically, the authors compare the allocation outcome with ex-ante preferences of elite male and with those of non-elite male. They want to check whether the chosen project aligns more with elite male or non-elite male. 

So, the authors ask the questions, Does direct democracy change how resource are allocated and Does direct democracy weaken elite's ability to get what they want.
After the projects are chosen, the authors check from their survey, what non-elites wanted and what elite wanted. If project chosen align with non-elite voters in direct voting and if project chosen align with elite voters in meeting consultancies, then it proves that direct voting shifts power away from elites and meeting consultancies decision making is dominated by elites. They want to rule out the case that elites and non-elites just happen to agree. Referendum reduces the impact/influence of elites over allocating outcomes.

- Theoretically the effect of reducing elite influence over resource allocation in welfare is ambiguous, as there is informational advantage with the village elites. 
- So, direct democracy made reduce overall welfare will limiting the influence of elites in decision making.
- Referenda improves villagers' perception of the local economy and the quality of local governance, even when type of project is controlled for. 
- Villagers' perception improve even when the projects are less aligned with elite's preferences.

## Background Information

The National Solidarity Program (NSP) coordinated with the authors in executing the field experiment. 
NSP was devised in 2002 by GOA to deliver services and infrastructure to rural sections of Afghanistan. The program is structured in two interventions: *(i) creation of elected Development council*  and *(ii) allocate grants to development council for implementation of village products.*

- A gender balanced development council mandated to have equal no. of male and female, total size proportional to number of families residing in the village. 
- Election of the members of the development through secret ballot.
- After formation of development council, NSP allocated a fund of $200 with cap of $60,000 per village to fund local development project. 
- The villagers need to contribute 10% of the project cost through labour. 
- Approx 40% of the development council members and 70% of the development council heads were pre-existing heads. 


## Experimental Design

125 villages out of 250 were randomly assigned to Referendum procedure and the remaining were assigned to Consultation Meeting. 
- ***Referendum:*** Both men and women are eligible to vote, by secret ballot. At least 50% of the eligible voter must vote in order for referendum to be valid. Projects with the most votes are selected for grants. Selected projects are prioritised by the number of votes received.
