#### Abstract 

Direct Democracy is designed to better align policy outcomes with citizen preferences. To test this hypothesis, the authors randomised 250 villages across Afghanistan selected projects by secret-ballot referenda or by consultation meetings. They find that referenda reduce the influence of local elites over both project type and location . Consistent with previous experimental results, they also find that referenda improve villagers' perceptions of the local economy and of the quality of local governance. However, they also find no systematic evidence that selecting projects via referenda increases the average impact of such projects.

#### What does the *Abstract* mean?

The authors want to check whether *direct democracy* leads to policy decisions that better match citizen's preferences compared to *consultation meetings*. In this study, authors randomly assigned 250 villages in Afghanistan to two types of design- (i) *Direct Democracy* and (ii) *Consultation meeting*.

The Authors find that *direct  democracy* reduces the influence of local elites over what kind of project the village needed and which location the project was going to be implemented. They also find evidences of improvement of villager's perception of the local economy and the quality of governance. Something like, The villagers had better trust in governance when they themselves elected their policies.

However, the authors didn't find any systematic difference in project outcomes.

## Introduction

Decentralisation is transference of power from the central government to the local authorities and it is seen as a way which promotes good governance, better accountability, better policy making which matches local preferences, etc. However, in many developing countries, the local elites (wealthy, local political leader, etc) divert the resources for their own benefit. Direct Democracy is thought to be that tool which helps in better resource allocation in accordance to people's preferences. So the authors asks this question- *whether direct democracy is an effective tool to reduce elite capture over the allocation*.

- A field experiment
- 250 villages randomly selected
- The norm in Afghanistan is mostly policy making with consultation making. Direct Democracy is against that norm.
- 125 villages were randomly assigned to select project through secret-ballot methodology and the remaining were assigned to select project through elected village development council.
- **Treatment Group:** Villages where projects are selected through secret-ballot method.
- **Control Group:** Villages where projects are selected through consultation meetings. 
- On referendum procedure, project fund allocation is decided based on most votes received while the consultation meeting procedure allocated funds based on the decision by village elected council members. 
- In order to isolate the effect of direct democracy on allocation outcomes and on the ability of the elites to realise their preferences specifically, the authors compare the allocation outcome with ex-ante preferences of elite male and with those of non-elite male. They want to check whether the chosen project aligns more with elite male or non-elite male. 

So, the authors ask the questions, **Does direct democracy change how resource are allocated and Does direct democracy weaken elite's ability to get what they want?**
After the projects are chosen, the authors check from their survey, what non-elites wanted and what elite wanted. If project chosen align with non-elite voters in direct voting and if project chosen align with elite voters in meeting consultancies, then it proves that direct voting shifts power away from elites and meeting consultancies decision making is dominated by elites. They want to rule out the case that elites and non-elites just happen to agree. Referendum reduces the impact/influence of elites over allocating outcomes.

- Theoretically the effect of reducing elite influence over resource allocation in welfare is ambiguous, as there is informational advantage with the village elites. 
- So, direct democracy made reduce overall welfare will limiting the influence of elites in decision making.
- Referenda improves villagers' perception of the local economy and the quality of local governance, even when type of project is controlled for. 
- Villagers' perception improve even when the projects are less aligned with elite's preferences.

## Background Information

The National Solidarity Program (NSP) coordinated with the authors in executing the field experiment. 
NSP was devised in 2002 by GOA to deliver services and infrastructure to rural sections of Afghanistan. The program is structured in two interventions: *(i) creation of elected Development council*  and *(ii) allocate grants to development council for implementation of village products.*

- A gender balanced development council mandated to have equal no. of male and female, total size proportional to number of families residing in the village. 
- Election of the members of the development through secret ballot.
- After formation of development council, NSP allocated a fund of $200 with cap of $60,000 per village to fund local development project. 
- The villagers need to contribute 10% of the project cost through labour. 
- Approx 40% of the development council members and 70% of the development council heads were pre-existing heads. 

#### Phasing of intervention and data collection

- The baseline survey was administered in September 2007, prior to the assignment of allocation procedures. 
- Development Council elections occurred between October 2007 and May 2008 and the resource allocation process took place between November 2007 and August 2008.
- Both Development council members and the resource allocation process were monitored.
- The mid-line survey was administered between June and October 2009 following the start of project implementation. 
- The end-line survey was administered between May and October 2011, at which time 99% of NSP funded projects on sample villages were completed.
- Data on location of NSP and non-NSP projects was collected between June and November 2011.

## Experimental Design

125 villages out of 250 were randomly assigned to Referendum procedure and the remaining were assigned to Consultation Meeting. 
- ***Referendum:*** Both men and women are eligible to vote, by secret ballot. At least 50% of the eligible voter must vote in order for referendum to be valid. Projects with the most votes are selected for grants. Selected projects are prioritised by the number of votes received. 
- ***Consultation meeting:*** The development council convenes and moderates a meeting, open to all villagers. The development council selects and priorities projects for funding.

#### Sample and Randomisation

The 250 villages were evenly split across ten districts. The 2007-2008 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA)  allows for a comparison of 250 sample villages.

###### Table 1 (Balance of Pre-Treatment covariates)

The table 1 wants to show that there's no statistical difference between the characteristics of control group and the treatment group and that the randomisation resulted in good balance between the villages assigned to the two groups. 
Only 1, Respondent believes people should pay taxes, among the 18 key variables show significant difference at 10% level with p-value of 0.096. 

The footnote says that errors are clustered at village level, which means, villagers in the same village may share unobserved traits (e.g., local culture, leadership, economic conditions), making their responses **more similar to each other** than to villagers in other villages, which can thus lead to *underestimated standard errors*. So clustering errors at village level adjust for within-village correlation. 

###### Table 2 (Participation by decision-making procedure)

Monitored the implementation of procedures in 127 randomly selected villages(63 meetings and 64 referenda). On Average 12 development council members and 143 villagers attended village meetings, which is about 1/3rd of the average adult population of the sample villages. 

The average number of male and female who turned out for  voting/village meeting were higher in villages which followed Referendum. 

## Data

To identify the effects of direct democracy on four sets of outcomes of interest: 
-  degree of alignment between resource allocation outcomes and elite and non-elite preferences. 
-  location of projects relative to the houses of members of the village elite.
- subjective measures of economic welfare and of the quality of local governance. 
- project implementation and performance.

##### Ex-ante project preferences

- Data on ex-ante preferences are drawn from baseline survey. 
- In each village, the survey was administrated to ten randomly selected heads-of household and a focus group of male leaders also a focus group of leading village women. 
- Group of male leaders were composed between six to nine.
- In each of the survey, respondents were asked to indicate a list of fifteen potential project types- the type of project they believed should be selected if the village was provided with a $60,000 grant. 
- The authors construct a village level dummy variable indicating the type of project most frequently preferred by each group of respondents. This provides village level measures of the preferences of male villagers and male elites. 
- The results in Table 3 indicates that there are no significant differences in the distribution of project preferences in villages assigned to two different allocation procedure.  The chi-square test does not reject the hypothesis that they are drawn from the same distribution.
- The null hypothesis in a chi-square test states that **there is no significant difference or association between the observed frequencies in a categorical dataset**.
- Chi-square test of independence, the null hypothesis is, **There is no association between the two categorical variables** and Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, the hypothesis is **The observed frequencies match the expected frequencies.**
- If the p-value is sufficiently small, the null hypothesis is rejected. Or if the Chi-square statistic is sufficiently large compared to the critical value. 


###### Project Location

The placement of a well for drinking water outside the house of the village headman, for instance, would disadvantage villagers living in other parts of the village. In order to estimate the effect of referenda on the location of projects vis-a-vis the residence of local elites, the authors collected the GPS coordinates of the development project in sample village during the endline survey that was administrated after the completion of development projects in 2011.
